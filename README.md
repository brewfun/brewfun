# Hey there! 👋 I'm BrewFun

## 🚀 Cloud Platforms Engineer | DevOps Engineer | Cloud Infrastructure Architect | Professional Infrastructure Whisperer

> With several years of turning coffee into cloud infrastructure and teaching servers how not to crash at 3 AM, I've mastered the ancient art of building scalable cloud platforms while simultaneously explaining why we can't just "turn it off and on again" to fix that one weird service.

### 🎯 What I Do

- **☁️ Cloud Platforms Engineering**: Designing and managing multi-cloud infrastructures that scale like magic
- **🔧 DevOps Engineering**: Building CI/CD pipelines so robust, even the most chaotic deployments succeed  
- **🏗️ Infrastructure as Code**: Crafting Terraform modules and CloudFormation templates that deploy entire environments
- **🤖 Automation & Orchestration**: Writing Python scripts that eliminate manual toil and human error
- **🔐 Cloud Security**: Implementing security best practices that keep compliance teams happy
- **📊 Monitoring & Observability**: Setting up alerting systems that page you only when it actually matters
- **🎓 Team Mentoring**: Teaching others the art of "cloud-first" thinking and infrastructure automation

### 📈 Track Record  

- 🎯 3+ Years of building cloud platforms that actually work in production
- 🚀 Designed multi-region AWS/GCP infrastructures serving thousands of users
- 📚 Mentoring experience - Turning manual processes into automated cloud workflows
- 🔧 Infrastructure automation that reduces deployment time from hours to minutes
- 📊 Cost optimization strategies that save companies significant cloud spend monthly
- ☸️ Side passion: Built K8s auto-installer web apps for rapid cluster deployment

### 💭 My Philosophy

> "The best cloud infrastructure is the one that scales automatically, heals itself, and only costs you what you actually use (not what AWS thinks you might need)."

**I believe in:**
- Cloud-native architectures that embrace failure and scale gracefully
- Infrastructure as Code so detailed, your entire stack can be rebuilt from git
- Automation that eliminates toil while keeping humans in the important decisions
- Making cloud platforms accessible to developers without hiding the underlying complexity

### 🔨 Current Projects

**Day Job**: Building enterprise cloud platforms with multi-region failover, auto-scaling, and cost optimization that actually works. Managing infrastructure that serves millions of requests while keeping the bill reasonable.

**Side Passion**: Developing **ToolsAuto** - a web-based K8s auto-installer because I got tired of manually setting up clusters for side projects. Choose between All-in-One (perfect for dev) or HA Secure (production-ready), and watch your cluster deploy through real-time logs.

### 🌱 What I'm Up To

- ☁️ **Professional**: Architecting multi-cloud platforms with advanced networking and security
- 🔧 **Infrastructure**: Designing Terraform modules for enterprise-scale cloud deployments
- 📊 **Cost Optimization**: Implementing FinOps practices and automated resource right-sizing
- 🤖 **Automation**: Building Python tools for cloud resource management and compliance
- 🎓 **Learning**: Advanced cloud-native architectures and serverless patterns
- 🔨 **Side Project**: [ToolsAuto K8s Auto Installer](https://github.com/brewfun/toolsauto) - Because manual cluster setup is so 2020

### 🎲 Fun Facts About Me

- ☕ My monitoring dashboards track both infrastructure health AND my daily coffee consumption
- 💸 I've saved more money through cloud cost optimization than I've spent on coffee (and that's saying something)
- 📚 I can explain AWS networking using only restaurant analogies
- 🎯 My Terraform modules have prevented more configuration drift than my colleagues realize
- 🚨 I've achieved the legendary status of "Person Who Actually Understands Cloud Billing"
- 🏗️ I measure success by uptime percentages and how much manual work I eliminate each sprint
